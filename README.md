## Project Overview & Summary: The Rick and Morty GraphQL API Explorer
This project is a multi-phase learning journey designed to build proficiency in GraphQL, from writing basic queries to integrating them into a modern, full-stack React application. The project uses the popular Rick and Morty API as its data source, providing a fun and engaging context for learning.

The work is segmented into four distinct directories (alx-graphql-0x00 to alx-graphql-0x02), each representing a progressive level of complexity and application.

## Learning Objectives
Upon completing this project, a learner will be able to:

### Level 0 (GraphQL Fundamentals):

Construct precise GraphQL queries to request specific data.
Understand and use arguments (like id and page) to filter and paginate results.
Structure queries to include only the necessary fields, avoiding over-fetching of data.
Differentiate between querying for a single item and a paginated list of items.

### Level 1 & 2 (Frontend Integration):

Set up a Next.js application with TypeScript, Apollo Client, and Tailwind CSS.
Configure Apollo Client to connect a React application to a GraphQL endpoint.
Use the useQuery hook to execute GraphQL operations within React components.
Manage local component state (e.g., for pagination) and refetch data based on state changes.
Structure a React application with clear separation of concerns (queries, interfaces, components).
